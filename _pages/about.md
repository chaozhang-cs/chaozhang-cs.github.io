I am a postdoc in the Data Systems Group at the University of Waterloo. I am working with [Renée J. Miller](https://rjmillerlab.github.io/) on data lakes. I worked with [Tamer Özsu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~tozsu/) on graph data management. Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Lyon (Lyon 1), working with [Angela Bonifati](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/angela.bonifati/). I received my PhD in computer science from the University of Clermont Auvergne, advised by [Farouk Toumani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0gPsmccAAAAJ&hl=en). I also worked closely with Inria and Oracle Labs (Zurich).

I work on data systems. My recent focus is on data systems and large language models, collectively referred to as Data Intelligence Platforms. My research interests include the following:
* Query Processing: heterogenous data; natural language queries; indexing methods; graph queries; OLAP; stream processing.
* Data Lakes: data discovery; vector and semantic search; metadata management; data integration; open lakehouse and AI.

<span style="color:red">I am looking for PhD, Postdoc, Master's Studnets, Research Interns, and Visiting Students. Please feel free to drop me a message.</span>
