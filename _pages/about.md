I am a postdoc in [Data Systems Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/data-systems-group/) at the University of Waterloo, working under the supervision of [Prof. Tamer Özsu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~tozsu/). Previously, I was a postdoc at Lyon 1 University, working with [Prof. Angela Bonifati](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/angela.bonifati/). 

I received my PhD in computer science from the University of Clermont Auvergne, advised by [Prof. Farouk Toumani](https://perso.limos.fr/~fatouman/).

My research is on data management systems, and my recent work focuses on graph data management and stream processing.
