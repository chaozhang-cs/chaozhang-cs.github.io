I am a postdoc in Data Systems Group at the University of Waterloo, working under the supervision of Prof. Tamer Özsu. Previously, I was a postdoc at Lyon 1 University, working with Prof. Angela Bonifati. 

I received my Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Clermont Auvergne, advised by Prof. Farouk Toumani.

I am interested in graph query processing, stream processing, and query rewriting.
